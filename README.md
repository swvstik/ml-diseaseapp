## This repository contains the source code of a machine-learning based web application useful for disease prediction: 'Pulse'.
### This is a web app that relies on provided datasets and utilizes them to provide outcomes, using machine-learning models created on Python.
This application takes in required user inputs such as blood pressure, age, etc. and predicts an outcome relative to the input arguments. The predicted outcome is derived from machine-learning models managed and trained using numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn, using Google Colaboratory as the medium. The front-end of this web application is built on Streamlit.
